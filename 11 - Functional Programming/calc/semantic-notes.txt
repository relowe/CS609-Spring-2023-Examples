Variables
- A variable must be declared before it is used.
- All variable names must be unique (no re-declaration)
- Numeric variables are assigned a zero at declaration time
- A variable can have one of the following types:
    - integer
    - real
- On assignment, all values are coerced into the variable type.
    ex:
        real x
        integer y

        x = 1.5
        y = x

    This is valid, and x will have the value of 1

- All expressions are computed in real mode and then cast to integers on 
  assignment.
